                <h2> The Magic of Animation</h2>
                <p> 

                    I am a huge fan of Motion Pictures, especially those that recreate the small beauties of life. Studio Ghibli is one of my favorite movie
                    studios as they are really good at reimagining the same magic we all had as children. I love the imagery they use, especially their depictions of magical places

                    <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Totoro01.jpg?fit=740%2C+9999&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C417px&ssl=1" alt="still cut of scene from ''My neighbor Totoro''">
                    
                    
                    or even simple scenes they make magic out of. My favorite movies curated by them are "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Spirited Away." What's funny is that 
                    I used to watch those shows as a kid, but when I rewatch them as an adult I interpret the movies completely differently. However, the magic
                    is still there. I am constantly filled with nostalgia of the emotions I felt when I first watched the movie.

                <h2> Travel to Worlds You've Never Been To</h2>
                <p> 
                    What do I like about animation, you may ask? I like that it creates possibilities that are solely fueled by human imagination. It has elements of fiction, yet is realistic enough for us to be able to imagine ourselves in those worlds or imagine those scenarios created in real life.

                    The characters in 
                    my favorite stories are always normal people - like me - who find themselves in magical situations and are whisked away to fantasy lands. My Neighbor Totoro, for example,
                    follows the story of two sisters who are navigating a new home and neighborhood by themselves. In the midst of their loneliness, they meet a friendly forest 
                    troll named Totoro who takes them on a series of adventures through the forest and the night sky.

                    Do you ever wonder how many childrens' lives are changed due to the creativity of animators? Here are the words of famous animator and 
                    movie director Hayao Miyazaki: "Well, yes. I believe that children's souls are the inheritors of historical memory from previous generations. 
                    It's just that as they grow older and experience the everyday world that memory sinks lower and lower. I feel I need to make a film that reaches down to that level. If I could do that I would die happy.""
