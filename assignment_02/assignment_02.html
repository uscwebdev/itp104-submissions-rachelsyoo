        <p> 
                I am a huge fan of Motion Pictures, especially those that recreate the small beauties of life. Studio Ghibli is one of my favorite movie
                studios as they are really good at reimagining the same magic we all had as children. I love the imagery they use, especially their depictions of magical places
                or even simple scenes they make magic out of. My favorite movies curated by them are "My Neighbor Totoro" and "Spirited Away." What's funny is that 
                I used to watch those shows as a kid, but when I rewatch them as an adult I interpret the movies completely differently. However, the magic
                is still there.
