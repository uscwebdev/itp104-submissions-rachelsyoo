        <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Rachel Yoo and I am currently a third-year at USC studying Law, History, & Culture and User Experience. As a designer, I want to be someone who pushes the boundaries of conventional human design rather than follow traditions. I want to help build products that elevate the human experience. </p>

        <h1> My Story </h1>
    </div>

    <div id="body">
        <p>I initially entered USC with a pre-law focus and an intent to go to law school. However, as I studied multiple topics within the program, I found that I loved what I studied - I just didnâ€™t have a passion to pursue law. While law would have been a very fulfilling career to pursue, I disliked its inflexible nature and individualism. I wanted to work in a career where I could use the same interpersonal and cultural skills I have been building over the past two years - in a field with no limits to my creativity. </p>
